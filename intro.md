# Radius User Empathy Group Activity

Radius is solving complex problems for complex organizations. On the Radius team, we all use Radius, Kubernetes, and Bicep every day and we deal with the quirks of our systems or write scripts to automate things every day. But our users do not have that luxury. New users have limited time to evaluate if Radius meets their needs those familiar with Radius just want it to work with their environment. Imagine how much more complicated things are for our users. Not only are they running production systems, but their organizations are more complex, they have security and regulatory requirements that we don't yet understand, and their core competency is not building cloud software.

For the next two and a half hours, you will no longer be a member of the Radius team—you are a platform engineer within the Developer Experience team at CableCo. You and your teammates are challenged with building an internal developer platform for the Enterprise division. The CableCo CIO has asked your team to build a proof of concept of an internal developer platform using Radius.

## Group Organization

You have been placed in a group of your teammates. 

| Group 1           | Group 2             | Group 3         | Group 4            | Group 5              |
| ----------------- | ------------------- | --------------- | ------------------ | -------------------- |
| Lakshmi Javadekar | Brooke Hamilton     | Jonathan Smith  | Nithya Subramanian | Allen Jones          |
| Sylvain Niles     | Reshma Abdul Rahim  | Karishma Chawla | Shruthi Kumar      | Aman Singh           |
| Will Smith        | Vishwanath Hiremath | Nicole James    | Yetkin Timocin     | Chakradhar Kotamraju |
|                   |                     |                 | Will Tsai          | Daniel Gerlag        |
|                   |                     |                 |                    | Nandita Valsan       |

Each group needs a few roles. When you breakout into your group, organize yourselves. 

* Platform engineer (everyone)
* Developer (only one person at certain times)
* Secretary (one person who will present your finding at the end)

## Timing

| Time           | Activity                                                     |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 1:00 – 1:15 PM | Plenary – Activity overview and Q&A                          |
| 1:15 – 1:30 PT | Breakout – Read CableCo background and platform requirements |
| 1:30 – 3:00 PT | Breakout – Implement your PoC                                |
| 3:00 – 3:30 PT | Plenary – Radius Customer Advisory Board                     |

## Objective

Build a proof of concept using Radius and any other relevant open-source solution which demonstrates as many of the requirements in the requirements document as possible. 

## Deliverables

Since you are building a proof of concept, you will not be able to implement all of the requirements. In this case, translate the requirements you were not able to meet into feature requests for the Radius team.

At 3:00 PT, we will hold the Radius Customer Advisory Board. Your group's secretary will be expected to present five minutes on:

* What are your platform engineering team's top challenges (overall, not just with Radius)?
* What benefits does Radius provide your company?
* What challenges did you face building an IDP using Radius?
* Provide a stack ranked list of feature requests for your platform engineering team
* How likely would you recommend Radius to another platform engineering team (0 Not at al likely – 10 Extremely likely)

At the end of the activity, submit your feedback using the form below.

## Activity Rules

1. **No customizations** – Remember that you are a platform engineer at CableCo, not a member of the Radius team. Platform engineers at CableCo don't have the time or expertise to submit code changes to Radius. You can submit issues or feature requests. 
2. **Follow the documentation** – Try your best to set aside what you know about Radius and follow the documentation. When you install Radius, follow the installation guide installing Radius manually, not from one of your own scripts. When you create a recipe, follow the how-to guide. 
3. **Think twice before introducing new technologies** – Almost every piece of technology is used within CableCo. Be a good citizen and try not to introduce something new and if you do, keep it minimal. (I'm looking at you Bicep.)
