# Radius User Empathy Group Activity

Radius is solving complex problems for complex organizations. On the Radius team, we all use Radius, Kubernetes, and Bicep every day and we deal with the quirks of our systems or write scripts to automate things every day. But our users do not have that luxury. New users have limited time to evaluate if Radius meets their needs those familiar with Radius just want it to work with their environment. Imagine how much more complicated things are for our users. Not only are they running production systems, but their organizations are more complex, they have security and regulatory requirements that we don't yet understand, and their core competency is not building cloud software.

For the next two and a half hours, you will no longer be a member of the Radius team. You have just joined the Developer Experience team at CableCo as a platform engineer. The CableCo CIO has asked your team to build a proof of concept for a internal developer platform using Radius for the Enterprise division. 

## Group Organization

You have been placed in a group of your teammates. 

| Group 1           | Group 2             | Group 3              | Group 4            | Group 5        |
| ----------------- | ------------------- | -------------------- | ------------------ | -------------- |
| Lakshmi Javadekar | Brooke Hamilton     | Chakradhar Kotamraju | Nicole James       | Allen Jones    |
| Sylvain Niles     | Mario Hewardt       | Jonathan Smith       | Nithya Subramanian | Aman Singh     |
| Will Smith        | Reshma Abdul Rahim  | Karishma Chawla      | Shruthi Kumar      | Daniel Gerlag  |
|                   | Vishwanath Hiremath | Yetkin Timocin       | Will Tsai          | Nandita Valsan |
|                   |                     |                      |                    | Ruokun Niu     |

Each group needs a few roles. You will need to organize yourselves in your group.

* Platform engineer (everyone)
* Developer (only one person at certain times)
* Secretary (one person who will present your finding at the end)

## Timing

| Time           | Activity                                                     |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 1:00 – 1:15 PM | Plenary – Activity overview and Q&A                          |
| 1:15 – 1:30 PT | Breakout – Read CableCo background and platform requirements |
| 1:30 – 3:00 PT | Breakout – Implement your PoC                                |
| 3:00 – 3:30 PT | Plenary – Radius Customer Advisory Board                     |

## Objective

Today's activity has two objectives:

1. Put ourselves in the shoes of a platform engineer at a large enterprise and learn about how they are organized, there technical constraints, and their overall challenges and requirements.
2. Implement a proof of concept using Radius as a first-time user would. 

## Deliverables

Since you are building a proof of concept, you will not be building a full IDP. You should capture feature requests along the way which would be important if you were building a full IDP within CableCo. You will need a stack ranked list of feature requests you feel are the highest priority for CableCo after completing the proof of concept.

At 3:00 PT, we will hold the Radius Customer Advisory Board. Your group's secretary will be expected to present five minutes on:

* What are your platform engineering team's top challenges (overall, not just with Radius)?
* What benefits does Radius provide your company?
* What challenges did you face building an IDP using Radius?
* Provide a stack ranked list of feature requests for your platform engineering team
* How likely would you recommend Radius to another platform engineering team (0 Not at al likely – 10 Extremely likely)

At the end of the activity, submit your feedback using this form: [Radius Customer Advisory Board feedback form](https://forms.office.com/r/emEQ23NuHv)

## Activity Guidelines

1. **No customizations** – Remember that you are a platform engineer at CableCo, not a member of the Radius team. Platform engineers at CableCo don't have the time or expertise to submit code changes to Radius. You can submit issues or feature requests. 
2. **Follow the documentation** – Try your best to set aside what you know about Radius and follow the documentation. When you install Radius, follow the installation guide installing Radius manually, not from one of your own scripts. When you create a recipe, follow the how-to guide.
3. **Prioritize requirements** – You will not be able to implement all of the requirements due to time limitations and Radius capabilities. Prioritize implementing the ones you believe are the highest priority to CableCo.
